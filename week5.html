        <h1>Week 5 Part 1</h1>
        <div class="part1">
            <h2>Ch14: HTML5 APIs</h2>
            <p>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by
                the
                browser. The names of these attributes can be decided by the developer, but they must use the following
                format:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with data-.</li>
                <li>Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores.</li>
                <li>Include an optional string value.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="code">
                <p>data-powers = 'flight superSpeed'</p>
                <p>data-rating = '5' </p>
                <p>data-dropdown </p>
                <p>data-user = 'DAZ' </p>
                <p>data-max-length = '32'</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Multimedia</h3>
            <p>An audio clip can be inserted into a page with the audio tag, using the src attribute to point to the
                audio
                file. A video clip can be inserted with the video tag, using the src attribute to point to the movie
                file. The controls attribute can be added (without any value) and will display the browser’s native
                controls, such as play, pause, and volume control, as can be seen in the screenshot below.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The play event, which fires when the clip starts and when it resumes after a pause</li>
                <li>The pause event, which fires when the clip is paused.</li>
                <li>The volumechange event, which fires when the volume is changed.</li>
                <li>The loadedmetadata event, which we saw in the note above, and which fires when all the video's
                    metadata
                    has loaded.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Drawing with Canvas</h3>
            <p>To add a canvas element to a page, the canvas tag is used specifying a height and width. Straight lines
                can
                be drawn employing the moveTo() and lineTo() methods.</p>
            <h2>Ch12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h2>
            <p>The first step to using canvas is to add a canvas element to the page. The text in between the canvas
                tags
                will only be shown if the canvas element is not supported by the visitor’s browser.</p>
            <div class="code">
                <p>var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas"); </p>
                <p>var context = canvas.getContext("2d"); </p>
                <p>context.strokeStyle = "red";</p>
                <p>context.fillStyle = "rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5)";</p>
                <p>context.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 100); “fills rectangle”</p>
                <p>context.strokeRect(10, 10, 100, 100);</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Saving Canvas Drawings</h3>
            <div class="code">
                <p>button name="saveButton" id="saveButton">Save Drawing /button</p>
                <p>function saveDrawing() {</p>
                <p>var canvas5 = document.getElementById("demo5");</p>
                <p>window.open(canvas5.toDataURL("image/png"));</p>
                <p>var button = document.getElementById("saveButton");</p>
                <p>button.addEventListener("click", saveDrawing, false);</p>
            </div>
            <h3>SVG</h3>
            <p>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe vector
                graphics
                using XML. XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. Like HTML, it’s a markup metalanguage. In plain
                English, it’s a system meant to annotate text.</p>
            <h3>Making Elements Draggable</h3>
            <p>In order to do that, we add the draggable attribute to them, and set the value to true. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="part2">
            <h2>An Introduction to Functions, Execution Context and the Call Stack</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>When we run our code two main things happen: It stores memory and it executes words with a meaning
                    in an
                    application. </li>
                <li>Execution context is the fact of going through each line of code, executing what they say and store
                    them
                    in memory.</li>
                <li>There is global memory where every global variable is store and function level or local memory.</li>
                <li>JavaScript is a language that is single threatened (goes line by line) and uses synchronous
                    execution.
                </li>
                <li>When an output of a function is not yet defined its default value is undefined. Its wait to be
                    execute
                    and then stores the new value there.</li>
                <li>When we call a function, the result becomes a global variable. Using return keyword.</li>
                <li>Call Stack is tracking our execution context. It uses some kind of layers to keep track of the
                    program.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How to understand Callbacks & Higher Order Functions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The principle of making our functions reusable is to change them or generalize them in order to
                    achieve
                    many tasks with a single function but not overloading it. </li>
                <li>A function declaration is not executed until it is called or stored in a variable.</li>
                <li>In JavaScript functions are first-class objects. That means that they have all of the properties of
                    objects. We can pass functions that are just objects into functions. They can be stored in
                    variables;
                    they can be stored as properties of other objects or they can be passed as argument’s inputs into
                    functions and they can be returned as the return value.</li>
                <li>Functions have one special property that objects don’t have, it is that they can be invoked. But
                    functions, despite being objects, can be invoked.</li>
                <li> Higher-order function is the outer function that takes in a function, and callback function is the
                    function we pass in.</li>
                <li>High-order and callback function simplify our code, they keep it DRY so we don’t repeat more code.
                    And
                    they let us run asynchronous code.</li>
            </ul>
