            <h2>Ch13: AJAX</h2>
            <p>Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously
                with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading. Web pages were no longer static,
                but
                dynamic applications.</p>
            <h3>Clients and Servers</h3>
            <p>The web of computers known as the internet can be separated into two parts: clients and servers. A
                client,
                such as a web browser, will request a resource (usually a web page) from a server, which processes the
                request and sends back a response to the client. Ajax allows JavaScript to request resources from a
                server
                on behalf of the client. The resources requested are usually JSON data or small fragments of text or
                HTML
                rather than a whole web page.</p>
            <h3>The Fetch API</h3>
            <p>An application programming interface (API) is a collection of methods that allows external access to
                another
                program or service. Many websites allow controlled access to their data via public APIs. An application
                programming interface (API) is a collection of methods that allows external access to another program or
                service. Many websites allow controlled access to their data via public APIs:</p>
            <div class="code">
                <p>fetch('https://example.com/data')</p>
                <p>.then( // code that handles the response )</p>
                <p>.catch( // code that runs if the server returns an error )</p>
                <p>A more complete example: </p>
                <p>const url = 'https:example.com/data';</p>
                <p>fetch(url)</p>
                <p>.then((response) => {</p>
                <p>if(response.ok) {</p>
                <p>return response;</p>
                <p>throw Error(response.statusText);</p>
                <p>.then( response => // do something with response )</p>
                <p>.catch( error => console.log('There was an error!') )</p>
            </div>
            <p>The redirect() method can be used to redirect to another URL. It creates a new promise that resolves to
                the
                response from the redirected URL: </p>
            <p>The text() method takes a stream of text from the response, reads it to completion and then returns a
                promise
                that resolves to a USVSting object that can be treated as a string in JavaScript.</p>
            <h3>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>GET requests to retrieve resources</li>
                <li>POST requests, usually used to create a resource but can actually perform any task</li>
                <li>PUT requests to upsert, which means insert a resource or update it entirely</li>
                <li>PATCH requests to make partial updates to a resource</li>
                <li>DELETE requests to delete a resource.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Headers Interface</h3>
            <p>has() – Can be used to check if the headers object contains the header provided as an argument. </p>
            <p>get() - Returns the value of the header provided as an argument. </p>
            <p>set() – Can be used to set a value of an already existing header, or create a new header with the value
                provided as an argument if it does not already exist. </p>
            <p>append() – Adds a new header to the headers object. </p>
            <p>delete() – Removes the header provided as an argument.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="part2">
            <h2>Forms</h2>
            <p>Forms are made up of a form element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and
                buttons.</p>
            <h3>Form Properties and Methods</h3>
            <p>The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically.</p>
            <p>The form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the
                HTML.</p>
            <p>The form.action property can be used to set the action attribute of a form, so it’s sent to a different
                URL
                to be processed on the server.</p>
            <h3>Form Controls</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>input fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads</li>
                <li>select menus for drop-down lists of options</li>
                <li>textara elements for longer text entry</li>
                <li>button elements for submitting and resetting forms</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Text Areas</h3>
            <p>A textarea element is used to enter long pieces of text over multiple lines such as a comment or blog
                post:
            </p>
            <h2>Using FormData Objects Effectively</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>None of the inputs will come through a form unless they have a name attribute. </li>
                <li>Use preventDefault() to prevent the page from reloading.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>MDN: Client-Side Form Validation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>validationMessage: Returns a localized message describing the validation constraints that the
                    control
                    doesn't satisfy (if any). If the control is not a candidate for constraint validation (willValidate
                    is
                    false) or the element's value satisfies its constraints (is valid), this will return an empty
                    string.
                </li>
                <li>validity: Returns a ValidityState object that contains several properties describing the validity
                    state
                    of the element. A few of the more common ones:</li>
                <li>willValidate: Returns true if the element will be validated when the form is submitted; false
                    otherwise.
                </li>
            </ul>
