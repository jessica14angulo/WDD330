            <h1>Week 2 Part 1</h1>
            <h2>Ch9: The Window Object</h2>
            <p>In a browser environment the global object is the window object, which represents the browser window that
                contains a web page.</p>
            <h3>The Browser Object Model</h3>
            <p>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain
                information about the browser and computer screen. Every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe
                has a
                window object.</p>
            <p>If you don’t know the name of the global object, you can also refer to it using the keyword this in the
                global scope:</p>
            <div class="code">
                <p>from within the global scope</p>
                <p>const global = this;</p>
            </div>
            <p>Global variables are variables that are created without using the const, let or var keywords. Global
                variables can be accessed in all parts of the program. Any global variable created is actually a
                property of
                the window object. In general, you should refer to global variables without using the window object.</p>
            <h3>Dialogs</h3>
            <p>There are three functions that produced dialogs in the browsers: alert(), confirm() and prompt().</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog
                    box:
                    window.alert('Hello')</li>
                <li>The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog
                    that shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel:
                    window.confirm('Do you wish to continue?');. window.confirm() dialog can be used as a final check to
                    see
                    if a user wants to delete a resource.</li>
                <li>The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a
                    message provided as an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text:
                    window.prompt('Please enter your name:');</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Browser Information</h3>
            <p>The window object has a navigator property that returns a reference to the Navigator object. The
                Navigator
                object contains information about the browser being used. </p>
            <p>window.navigator.userAgent</p>
            <p>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page.
            </p>

            <div class="code">
                <p>window.location.href </p>
                <p>https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja</p>
            </div>
            <p>The protocol property returns a string describing the protocol used (such as http, https, pop2, ftp
                etc.).
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                <p> window.location.protocol </p>
                <p>"https:"</p>
            </div>
            <p>The host property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL and the port number:</p>
            <div class="code">
                <p>window.location.host</p>
                <p>www.sitepoint.com</p>
            </div>
            <p>The hostname property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL:</p>
            <div class="code">
                <p>window.location.hostname</p>
                <p> "www.sitepoint.com"</p>
            </div>
            <p>The port property returns a string describing the port number, although it will return an empty string if
                the
                port is not explicitly stated in the URL:</p>
            <div class="code">
                <p>window.location.port""</p>
            </div>
            <p>The pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the domain:</p>
            <p>The search property returns a string that starts with a “?” followed by the query string parameters. It
                returns an empty string if there are no query string parameters. </p>
            <div class="code">
                <p>window.location.search</p>
                <p>"?q=javascript&limit=24&offset=0&page=1&</p>
                <p>content_types[]=All&slugs[]=all&states[]=available&order="</p>
            </div>
            <p>The hash property returns a string that starts with a “#” followed by the fragment identifier. It returns
                an
                empty string if there is no fragment identifier:</p>
            <p>The origin property returns a string that shows the protocol and domain where the current page originated
                from. </p>
            <p>The window.location object also has the following methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The reload() method can be used to force a reload of the current page. It will force the browser to
                    reload the page from the server.</li>
                <li>The assign() method can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter, for
                    example: </li>
                <li>The replace() method is almost the same as the assign() method, except the current page will not be
                    stored in the session history, so the user will be unable to navigate back to it using the back
                    button.
                </li>
                <li>The toString() method returns a string containing the whole URL:</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Browser History</h3>
            <p>The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the
                current browser session.</p>
            <p>The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at the current
                page.</p>
            <p>The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where 0 is the current page.</p>
            <p>There are also the window.history.forward() and window.history.back() methods that can be used to
                navigate
                forwards and backwards by one page respectively.</p>
            <h3>Controlling Windows</h3>
            <p>A new window can be opened using the window.open() method. The close() method can be used to close a
                window,
                assuming you have a reference to it. It is also possible to move a window using the window.moveTo()
                method.
                You can resize a window using the window.resizeTo() method</p>
            <h3>Screen Information</h3>
            <p>The window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on. You can find
                out
                the height and width of the screen in pixels using the height and width properties. The availHeight and
                availWidth can be used to find the height and width of the screen, excluding any operating system menus.
            </p>
            <h3>The Document Object</h3>
            <p>The document.write() method simply writes a string of text to the page. If a page has already loaded, it
                will
                completely replace the current document.</p>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>Cookies take the form of a text file that contain a list of name/value pairs separated by semicolons.
                They
                can be used for personalizing a user’s browsing experience, storing user preferences, keeping track of
                user
                choices (such as a shopping cart), authentication and tracking users.</p>
            <p>To create a cookie, you assign it to JavaScript’s “cookie jar”, using the document.cookie property.
                document.cookie = 'name=Superman'; </p>
            <p>To see the current contents of the cookie jar, simply enter document.cookie. Cookies can be made
                persistent ―
                that is, lasting beyond the browser session ― by adding "; expires=date" to the end of the cookie when
                it’s
                set, using format Day, DD-Mon-YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT. To remove a cookie, you need to set it to expire at a
                time
                in the past: If a cookie is a session cookie, it will expire when the tab or window is closed. </p>
            <h3>Timing Functions</h3>
            <p>The window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of
                milliseconds as its second parameter.</p>
            <p>The window.setInterval() method works in a similar way to window.setTimeout(), except that it will
                repeatedly
                invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds. To stop this, we can use the
                window.clearInterval() method and the variable repeat as an argument.</p>
            <h3>MDN The Content Template Element</h3>
            <p>The HTML element is a mechanism for holding HTML that is not to be rendered immediately when a page is
                loaded
                but may be instantiated subsequently during runtime using JavaScript.</p>
            <h2>Attributes</h2>
            <p>However, the HTMLTemplateElement has a content property, which is a read-only DocumentFragment containing
                the
                DOM subtree which the template represents.</p>
            <h3>Avoiding DocumentFragment pitfall</h3>
            <p>A DocumentFragment is not a valid target for various events, as such it is often preferable to clone or
                refer
                to the elements within it.</p>

            <h1>Week 2 Part 2</h1>
            <h2>Ch10: Testing and Degugging</h2>
            <p>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings There are typically 3 types of errors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is
                    interacting.</li>
                <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple
                    as
                    a typo.</li>
                <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with
                the
                error. Like trying to call a method that is nonexistent. An exception will also produce a stack trace.
                This
                is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.</p>
            <p>A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This
                means the program will continue to run after a warning.</p>
            <h3>Strict Mode</h3>
            <p>To see it in action, if you try to assign a value to a variable that is undeclared in strict mode, you'll
                get
                an exception, instead of a warning, it can also be used inside functions only:</p>
            <div class="code">
                <p>'use strict';</p>
                <p>e = 2.718;</p>
                <p>ReferenceError: e is not defined</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Linting Tools</h3>
            <p>Linting tools such as JS Lint,JS Hint, and ES Lint can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code,
                beyond
                simply using strict mode. Passing a lint test is no guarantee that your code is correct, but it will
                mean it
                will be more consistent and less likely to have problems.</p>
            <h3>Feature Detection</h3>
            <p>The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use feature detection. This is done
                using an if statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying to actually call the
                method.
            </p>
            <h3>Debugging in the Browser</h3>
            <p>It can be useful to create what are known as breakpoints, which halt the progress of the code and allow
                us to
                view the value of different variables at that point in the program.</p>
            <h3>The Trusty Alert</h3>
            <p>The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog at certain points in the
                code:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                <p>function amIOldEnough(age){</p>
                <p>if (age 12) {/p palert(age);</p>
                <p>return 'No, sorry.';</p>
                <p>} else if (age 18) {/p preturn 'Only if you are accompanied by an adult.';}</p>
                <p>else {</p>
                <p>return 'Yep, come on in!';}}</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Using the Console</h3>
            <p>console.log() method can be used to log the value of variables at different stages of the program,
                although
                it will not actually stop the execution of the program in the same way as alert() does.</p>
            <h3>Debugging Tools</h3>
            <p>One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will create a breakpoint in your code that
                will
                pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to.</p>
            <h3>Throwing Exceptions</h3>
            <p>It’s also possible to throw your own exceptions using the throw statement. The throw statement can be
                applied
                to any JavaScript expression, causing the execution of the program to stop: throw new Error('Something
                has
                gone badly wrong!');</p>
            <h3>try, catch, and finally</h3>
            <p>If we suspect a piece of code will result in an exception, we can wrap it in a try block. This will run
                the
                code inside the block as normal, but if an exception occurs it will pass the error object that is thrown
                onto a catch block.</p>
            <p>A finally block can be added after a catch block. This will always be executed after the try or catch
                block,
                regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.</p>
            <h2>How Single-Page Applications Work</h2>
            <p>A single-page application (SPA) is a website that re-renders its content in response to navigation
                actions
                (e.g. clicking a link) without making a request to the server to fetch new HTML. Internal state SPAs are
                limited because there is only one “entry”. A single entry means that you always start at the root when
                you
                enter the application. With location-based SPAs, you can share a link and be confident that anyone
                opening
                that link will see the same thing as you because the location is always updating as you navigate.</p>
            <h3>Location Primer</h3>
            <p>While the URL in the address bar is what users see and interact with, SPAs use window.location. This
                allows
                you to interact with the different parts of the URL without having to parse it yourself.</p>
            <p>When a browser navigates, a request is sent to a server and the browser uses the response to create a
                Document object. The Document describes the page (the DOM) and provides methods for interacting with it.
                window.document is a browser tab’s active Document.</p>
            <p>As you’re clicking links and navigating through pages, the browser tab is building up a session history.
                If
                you press the browser’s back button, the browser will use the current entry to determine the “new”
                current
                entry (current.index - 1). The “old” current entry’s Document will be unloaded and the “new” current
                entry’s
                Document will be loaded.</p>
            <p>Instead of creating a new Document for every location, the History API re-uses the active Document by
                updating it to reflect the new location. The History API has three core functions: pushState(),
                replaceState(), and go(). These (and the rest of the API) are accessed via window.history. </p>
            <h2>The problem with single page apps</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Configure the server to point all paths on a domain back to the root index.html file. For example,
                    todolist.com and todolist.com/lists should both point to the same file.</li>
                <li>Suppress the default behavior when someone clicks a link that points to another page in the app.
                </li>
                <li>Use more JavaScript—history.pushState()—to update the URL without triggering a page reload.</li>
                <li>Match the URL against a map of routes, and serve the right content based on it.</li>
                <li>If your URL has variable information in it (like a todolist ID, for example), parse that data out of
                    the
                    URL.</li>
                <li>Detect when someone clicks the browser’s back button/forward button, and update the URL and UI.</li>
                <li>Update the title element on the page.</li>
                <li>Use even more JavaScript to dynamically focus the content area when the content changes (for
