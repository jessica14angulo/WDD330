        <h2>Ch9: The Window Object</h2>
        <p>In a browser environment the global object is the window object, which represents the browser window that
            contains a web page.</p>
        <h3>The Browser Object Model</h3>
        <p>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain
            information about the browser and computer screen. Every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a
            window object.</p>
        <p>If you don’t know the name of the global object, you can also refer to it using the keyword this in the
            global scope:</p>
        <div class="code">
            <p>from within the global scope</p>
            <p>const global = this;</p>
        </div>
        <p>Global variables are variables that are created without using the const, let or var keywords. Global
            variables can be accessed in all parts of the program. Any global variable created is actually a property of
            the window object. In general, you should refer to global variables without using the window object.</p>
        <h3>Dialogs</h3>
        <p>There are three functions that produced dialogs in the browsers: alert(), confirm() and prompt().</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box:
                window.alert('Hello')</li>
            <li>The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog
                that shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel:
                window.confirm('Do you wish to continue?');. window.confirm() dialog can be used as a final check to see
                if a user wants to delete a resource.</li>
            <li>The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a
                message provided as an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text:
                window.prompt('Please enter your name:');</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Browser Information</h3>
        <p>The window object has a navigator property that returns a reference to the Navigator object. The Navigator
            object contains information about the browser being used. </p>
        <p>window.navigator.userAgent</p>
        <p>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page.</p>

        <div class="code">
            <p>window.location.href </p>
            <p>https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja</p>
        </div>
        <p>The protocol property returns a string describing the protocol used (such as http, https, pop2, ftp etc.).
        </p>
        <div class="code">
            <p> window.location.protocol </p>
            <p>"https:"</p>
        </div>
        <p>The host property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL and the port number:</p>
        <div class="code">
            <p>window.location.host</p>
            <p>www.sitepoint.com</p>
        </div>
        <p>The hostname property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL:</p>
        <div class="code">
            <p>window.location.hostname</p>
            <p> "www.sitepoint.com"</p>
        </div>
        <p>The port property returns a string describing the port number, although it will return an empty string if the
            port is not explicitly stated in the URL:</p>
        <div class="code">
            <p>window.location.port""</p>
        </div>
        <p>The pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the domain:</p>
        <p>The search property returns a string that starts with a “?” followed by the query string parameters. It
            returns an empty string if there are no query string parameters. </p>
        <div class="code">
            <p>window.location.search</p>
            <p>"?q=javascript&limit=24&offset=0&page=1&</p>
            <p>content_types[]=All&slugs[]=all&states[]=available&order="</p>
        </div>
        <p>The hash property returns a string that starts with a “#” followed by the fragment identifier. It returns an
            empty string if there is no fragment identifier:</p>
        <p>The origin property returns a string that shows the protocol and domain where the current page originated
            from. </p>
        <p>The window.location object also has the following methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The reload() method can be used to force a reload of the current page. It will force the browser to
                reload the page from the server.</li>
            <li>The assign() method can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter, for
                example: </li>
            <li>The replace() method is almost the same as the assign() method, except the current page will not be
                stored in the session history, so the user will be unable to navigate back to it using the back button.
            </li>
            <li>The toString() method returns a string containing the whole URL:</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Browser History</h3>
        <p>The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the
            current browser session.</p>
        <p>The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at the current
            page.</p>
        <p>The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where 0 is the current page.</p>
        <p>There are also the window.history.forward() and window.history.back() methods that can be used to navigate
            forwards and backwards by one page respectively.</p>
        <h3>Controlling Windows</h3>
        <p>A new window can be opened using the window.open() method. The close() method can be used to close a window,
            assuming you have a reference to it. It is also possible to move a window using the window.moveTo() method.
            You can resize a window using the window.resizeTo() method</p>
        <h3>Screen Information</h3>
        <p>The window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on. You can find out
            the height and width of the screen in pixels using the height and width properties. The availHeight and
            availWidth can be used to find the height and width of the screen, excluding any operating system menus.</p>
        <h3>The Document Object</h3>
        <p>The document.write() method simply writes a string of text to the page. If a page has already loaded, it will
            completely replace the current document.</p>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>Cookies take the form of a text file that contain a list of name/value pairs separated by semicolons. They
            can be used for personalizing a user’s browsing experience, storing user preferences, keeping track of user
            choices (such as a shopping cart), authentication and tracking users.</p>
        <p>To create a cookie, you assign it to JavaScript’s “cookie jar”, using the document.cookie property.
            document.cookie = 'name=Superman'; </p>
        <p>To see the current contents of the cookie jar, simply enter document.cookie. Cookies can be made persistent ―
            that is, lasting beyond the browser session ― by adding "; expires=date" to the end of the cookie when it’s
            set, using format Day, DD-Mon-YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT. To remove a cookie, you need to set it to expire at a time
            in the past: If a cookie is a session cookie, it will expire when the tab or window is closed. </p>
        <h3>Timing Functions</h3>
        <p>The window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of
            milliseconds as its second parameter.</p>
        <p>The window.setInterval() method works in a similar way to window.setTimeout(), except that it will repeatedly
            invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds. To stop this, we can use the
            window.clearInterval() method and the variable repeat as an argument.</p>
        <h3>MDN The Content Template Element</h3>
        <p>The <template> HTML element is a mechanism for holding HTML that is not to be rendered immediately when a
                page is loaded but may be instantiated subsequently during runtime using JavaScript.</p>
        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <p>However, the HTMLTemplateElement has a content property, which is a read-only DocumentFragment containing the
            DOM subtree which the template represents.</p>
        <h3>Avoiding DocumentFragment pitfall</h3>
        <p>A DocumentFragment is not a valid target for various events, as such it is often preferable to clone or refer
            to the elements within it.</p>
